# hello-world
"The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming," according to GitHub. This is a simple exercise to create something where I can store ideas, resources, or share and discuss things with someone other than myself! :)

A little bit about myself: I am a lover of learning - most especially in the realm of languages, dancing, and filmmaking.
